# Introduction To Statistics

Statistics gives us the language to interview, understand, and use data.
We'll give you the basic literacy to navigate your later courses and hopefully
see the world a bit differently afterwards.

### Prerequisites
- Algebra that uses the summation sign with subscripts

### Textbooks / References
- Recommended: [Stats: Data and Models by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/8610380)


### Timeline
I reserve the right to change the ordering and the content for the course throughout the semester.

TAs
  - OH: TBD
Help room
  - Hours TBD
Online Discussion on Ed:
  - Login through Canvas
  - The TAs will only check the online discussion for 30 minutes each weekday. Do not expect an immediate response so please start your work early.

### Grading
If your final grade is in [93-100], you will earn at least an A, [90-93) will earn at least an A-, [87-90) will earn at least a B+, etc. A grading curves may occur depending on the class performance but I will not curve downwards. I may not give out A+'s in this class.

#### - Homeworks (30%)
  - Late homeworks will receive 0 credit.
  - Your lowest homework will be dropped. This is mostly to accommodate people enrolling in the course late.
  - Extensions will only be given in the event of a emergency.
  - These should be submitted on Canvas.
  - Each homework has the same weight.
#### - Exams (65%)
  - Late projects will be penalized by 50% for each day it's late.
  - Projects should be submitted on Canvas.
  - Having too many exams is not a reason to change your exam time.
#### - Participation (5%)
  - Instead of attendance, in class activities, recorded through Canvas, is how we'll grade this.
  - If you surpass 75% here, you'll receive the full credit for participation, otherwise you'll receive whatever percentage you earned.
