# INTRODUCTION TO STATISTIC

Statistics gives us the language to interview, understand, and use data.
We'll give you the basic literacy to navigate your later courses and hopefully
see the world a bit differently afterwards.

### Prerequisites
- Algebra

### Textbooks / References
- [Stats: Data and Models by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/8610380)

### Grading
If your final grade is in [93-100], you will earn at least an A, [90-93) will earn at least an A-, [87-90) will earn at least a B+, etc. A grading curves may occur depending on the class performance but I will not curve downwards. I may not give out A+'s in this class.

#### - Homeworks (30%)
  - Late homeworks will receive 0 credit
  - Homeworks will receive 0 credit if the code + write up is not submitted in both the .ipynb/.Rmd AND the knitted PDF or HTML form.
#### - Exams (60%)
  - Late projects will be penalized by 50% for each day it's late.
  - Projects should be submitted on Canvas
#### - Participation (10%)
  - Instead of attendance, in class activities, recorded through Canvas, is how we'll grade this.
  - If you surpass 75% here, you'll receive the full credit for participation, otherwise you'll receive 0 credit.
