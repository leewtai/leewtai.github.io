# Introduction To Statistics

Statistics gives us the language to interview, understand, and use data.
We'll give you the basic literacy to navigate your later courses and hopefully
see the world a bit differently afterwards.

### Prerequisites
- Algebra that uses the summation sign with subscripts

### Textbooks / References
- Our main text: [SticiGui](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/toc.htm) from UC Berkeley by Philip Stark
- what other sections are using: [Stats: Data and Models by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/8610380)


### Timeline
I reserve the right to change the ordering and the content for the course throughout the semester.

### Logistics
Lectures:
  [TuTh 10:10am - 11:25am,  402 Chandler](https://vergil.registrar.columbia.edu/#/courses/APPLIED%20DATA%20MINING)

### Where to ask questions

- Instructor - Wayne Tai Lee (wtl2109)
  - OH: TBD
- TA - Ling Chen (lc3521)
  - OH: TBD
- Help room
  - Hours TBD
- Online Discussion on Ed:
  - Login through Canvas
  - The TA + grader will only check the online discussion for 30 minutes each weekday. Do not expect an immediate response so please start your work early.

### Grading
If your final grade is in [93-100], you will earn at least an A, [90-93) will earn at least an A-, [87-90) will earn at least a B+, etc. A grading curves may occur depending on the class performance but I will not curve downwards. I may not give out A+'s in this class.

#### - Homeworks (30%)
  - Late homeworks will receive 0 credit.
  - Your lowest homework will be dropped. This is mostly to accommodate people enrolling in the course late.
  - Extensions will only be given in the event of a emergency.
  - These should be submitted on Canvas.
  - Each homework has the same weight.
#### - Exams (65%)
  - You can request to take the exam earlier than scheduled, but this request should come at least a week before the exam takes place.
  - Having too many exams is not a reason to change your exam time.
#### - Participation (5%)
  - Instead of attendance, in class activities, recorded through Canvas, is how we'll grade this.
  - If you surpass 75% here, you'll receive the full credit for participation, otherwise you'll receive whatever percentage you earned.
