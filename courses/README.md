## Courses

My professional background started in research, customer-facing data science models,
data quality, then finally consulting. My teaching philosophy is highly influenced by
this. I believe students need to learn to turn ideas into mathematically
definitions, then into executable code with actual data.

Here's a list of my personal belief what people with different degrees should be able to do:
- A student with a minor in statistics should be able to **recognize problems** and
  know the appropriate technical words to search for solutions e.g.
  if the data is not homoskedastic, what could go wrong?
- A student with a major in statistics should be able to think of how to fix the
  problem, e.g. transform the data or using weighted least squares could address
  issues with heteroskedasticity. This is limited to "well-known" problems.
- A student with a masters should be able to read papers and execute state of
  the art methods and perform minor tweaks on existing algorithms.
- A PhD student should be able to discover new methods for unsolved problems


#### Courses Taught
- [Statistical Computing](stat_computing/README.md)
  - Statistical computing focuses on data manipulation, simulation, and data visualization.
    The goal is to develop the necessary skills for you to verify the various statistical
    concepts you've learned and will learn in the future.
- [Linearity Regression](linear_regression/README.md)
  - Linear regression is the most foundational tool in machine learning and
    multivariate statistics. It demonstrates the simplest "model" that connects
    problems to data and the challenges faced by fancier models.
- [Applied Statistics](applied_methods/README.md)
  - There is no class that can teach you all the "applied statistical methods" out there.
    This is a topics course that introduces methods that tackle data collection to dealing
    with dependent data, to censored datasets, to finally topics on some causal inference.
- [Pre-Research Seminar](../pre_research/README.md)
  - This seminar is meant to give students who are interested in statistical research some basic
    experience and skills before pursuing research with research faculty (possibly non-Statistics
    faculty). The goal is for you to identify a professor and initiate research towards the end
    of the semester.

#### Ideas for future courses:
- Spatial statistics
- Data mining as a deep dive exercise, contrast with causal inference
- Data science class?
  - Data quality
  - Interactions between models
  - Communication and consulting
  - Data science for social workers

## Miscellaneous Teaching Materials

#### Going Virtual
In 2019, COVID-19 has forced students to learn remotely. To accommodate this,
I've made some [videos using open-sourced software](going_virtual.md). 

#### Self reflection on teaching
Here are some unorganized [self-reflections from teaching](teaching-reflections.md) semester to semester.
These are meant for myself but feel free to read them.
