# Project 1: Choose your own adventure

Here are a list of possible projects to try out:
- Predicting churn in the NYC civil servants. Replacing people is costly and atypical departures could signal issues in management.
  - Using the [payroll](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/about_data) from different years, we can infer who has left the NYC payroll.
  - Does the [budget](https://council.nyc.gov/budget/) help us predict this?
  - Does the [census](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) help us predict this?
- Tariffs are coming. Predicting import/export alternatives for different products or different countries can be useful.
  - The monthly changes in import/exports can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/international-trade.html)
- Housing prices is a major concern for young people.
  - Does the [census](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) contains information on spending on housing over the years
  - [Social vulnerability](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/index.html#:~:text=Social%20vulnerability%20refers%20to%20the,and%20other%20community%2Dlevel%20stressors.) talks about how different neighborhoods face different risk factors.
- Data mining on menus. NY Public Library has a [What's on the menu? Project](http://curatingmenus.org/data_dictionary/) and its data, digitized versions of the menus, is posted [here](https://nypl-menus-data.s3.amazonaws.com/gzips/2023_03_16_07_02_35_data.tgz)
  - Do we see the different cuisines/cultures from simply parsing menus?
  - Can we predict changes in menus?
  - Can we predict population changes from the menus? (This might require some old demographic data that's beyond the American Community Survey)
- Mining geospatial datasets listed [here](https://www.earthengine.app/)
  - E.g. predicting [forest loss](https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change#dl=4;old=off;bl=off;lon=263.6870529731459;lat=17.519625070033978;zoom=5;) or its impact, e.g. CO2 maps from [Planet Lab](https://developers.planet.com/) (application required!)
- You can make this a trial run for your final project as well.
