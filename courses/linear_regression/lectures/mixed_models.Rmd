Recall the trustworthiness problem in Study 3.

- The main dependent variable is the "highlighted response" which is `Response.bordered` in our data.
- `avg_trust` is the average trustworthiness rating for the single-faced photos.
- `Response.single` is the response for the single face
- `Response` is the response for the ensemble


## Do we see evidence of an individual effect?

E.g. are certain individuals biased in terms of ratings? (What does this mean?)


```{r}
df <- read.csv("~/repos/leewtai.github.io/courses/linear_regression/section/rep_papers/trustworthiness/data/S3/trusthworthiness.csv")

drop_cols <- c("X", "attention_check_response", "attention_check_response.bordered", "attention_check_response.single", "zip", "IP", "Study", "Trial_Component")
df[drop_cols] <- NULL

head(df)

```


## Different model choices

Sticking with lm(), let's fit the model against:

- `Response.single` and `Response`
- Above + `pic_id`
- Above + `subjID`

```{r}
mod <- lm(Response.bordered ~ Response.single + Response, df)
head(summary(mod)$coefficients)


mod2 <- lm(Response.bordered ~ Response.single + Response + pic_id, df)
head(summary(mod2)$coefficients)

df["subjID"] <- as.factor(df$subjID)
mod3 <- lm(Response.bordered ~ Response.single + Response + subjID, df)
head(summary(mod3)$coefficients)
```



```{r}
library(lme4)
library(Matrix)

# copied from Chwe's code
# s3_main = lmer(Response.bordered ~ Response.single * Response + (1 + Response.single + Response|subjID) + (1|pic_id), data = df, control = lmerControl(optimizer = 'bobyqa'))

```
