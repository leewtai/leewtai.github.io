```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Simulating from known distributions

```{r}
n <- 1000

# Normals natually occur given the CLT; symmetric (i.e. same prob to be on the left and right of the mean)
normals <- rnorm(n)
# most random random variable; symmetric
uniforms <- runif(n, min=-100, max=100)
# This is how we get tails/extremes!~
exponentials <- rexp(n)

hist(uniforms)
```

## Bootstrapping by sampling from existing data

```{r}
dice_outcomes <- 1:6

sim_die_rolls <- sample(dice_outcomes,
                        size=100,
                        replace=TRUE)
```


## Simulations for the sample average

  
```{r}

```

How would we verify Law of Large Numbers?

```{r}



```
