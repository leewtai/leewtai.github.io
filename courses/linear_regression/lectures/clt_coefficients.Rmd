## Calculate the SE of the coefficients

We want to quantify the SE of the coefficients from regression.

```{r}
n <- 100
x <- runif(n, -1, 1)

b0 <- 3
b1 <- 3.14

error <- rnorm(n, sd = 2)

y <- b0 + b1 * x + error

slr <- lm(y ~ x)
```


How would we do it? Copy parts of the code above that needs to be simulated!
Hint: how did we do it for the average?

```{r}


```


## What would happen if we changed the error distribution?
