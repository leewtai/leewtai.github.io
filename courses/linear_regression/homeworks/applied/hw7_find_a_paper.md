# Read a paper with a model in it

The goal of this homework is really to get you to start reading what your professors are working on!
This homework is graded on effort, the grader will see if your links actually work.

## Q0 - Who is still publishing?

Choose 8 professors in your (intended) major(s) and create the following in a Google Sheet with "View" access for LionMail.
The sheet should have the following columns (column names should be in the first row of your sheet):

- `first_name`: the first name on their faculty page
- `last_name`: the last name on their faculty page
- `full_name`: their full name on their faculty page in the order displayed on the department website.
- `faculty_homepage`: this should be the link to their faculty website that lists their papers (this is likely not within the department's page). If none exist, leave this blank
- `number_published_2021_2023`: this should be the number of published papers they had in 2021-today
- `number_published_2018_2020`: this should be the number of published papers they had in 2018-2020
- `selection_criterion`: how did you choose this faculty member? This could be one of the following:
  - `"likely future instructor"`: if this is someone you chose because you'll be taking their class or hoping to take their class in the near future
  - `"random"`: if this is someone you chose because you randomized all the faculty (using sample()) and got them
  - `"convenient"`: if this is someone you chose becaues they were easy (e.g. top of the faculty page)
  - `"word of mouth"`: if this is someone you chose becaues you heard good things about them

## Q1 - Pick one paper

Pick one paper from **2020-2023** and answer the following.

- Please provide a link to the paper?
- What year was this published
- What journal was this published in (arxiv is acceptable)
- What is the title of the paper
- What is the research question in 2 sentences?
- Copy/paste the introduction into [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) and ask it, "What is the research question of this paper in 2 sentences?" Please paste its reply here.
- What is the "population" in the paper (population as in the group they're hoping to model)
- If possible, does the model used in the paper have a name? Report that model here.
- What are the inputs (X), parameters (betas), and output (Y) of the model?
  - You do not need to detail all the values, only those mentioned by the authors
- How did the paper talk about the uncertainty of the model? e.g.
  - significance in the parameters imply the model is random
  - cross validated the predictions
  - applied the model on different subsets and compared how they've changed
  - ...
- What is the conclusion of the paper, what aspect of their model did they examine to reach this conclusion?
- Did you enjoy reading the paper?
- Was a dataset provided/mentioned that would allow us to verify their conclusions?
