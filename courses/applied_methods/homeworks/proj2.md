# Project 2: Working with spatial/temporal datasets and combining it with 3rd party data 

You only need to pick one of the following possible problems:
- [assassination classroom](../../../usecases_data/gps_assasination)
- [forecasting corn yields](../../../usecases_data/forecast_corn_yield)

Both questions above are somewhat heavy on the prediction application. Please also answer: "is there an obvious usecase for quantifying the uncertainty?"
