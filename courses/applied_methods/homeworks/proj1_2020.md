# Project 1: What percentage of people are wearing masks in public?

This project is trying to estimate "what percentage of people are wearing masks in public?"

Wearing masks is a common practice in Asia to prevent others from getting sick and the
same rationale applies to preventing the spread of COVID-19. [NY state advises](https://forward.ny.gov/protect-yourself-and-your-family-coronavirus-covid-19) people to "Wear a face mask or cloth face covering that covers your nose and mouth when in public" but this policy is not uniform across the nation.

The goal of the project is to expose you to the challenges during data collection and understand
that no data collection process is perfect. The key is the ability to identify the shortcomings
and propose solutions rather than executing a perfect sampling. However, you will need
to go outdoors to finish this project.

You should write this report treating your peers as your target audience. 
Your description on the measurement process, however, should be written as if targeting a high school
student. There is no page limit.

### Deliverables
- A report that should include:
  - A sampling methodology which defines your population, sampling frame, and unit of measurement.
    - What are the stages of in your sampling methodology? Your proposed method must be feasible if you had a year to do this.
    - Normally, you would set a desired-accuracy for your project, then use the variance formulas for various sampling strategies to then determine the number of samples you should collect. Since this topic course does not dive into the variance calculations, you will not need to describe this step but you should know that we are skipping this intentionally.
  - A measurement procedures should define what constitutes as "wearing a mask" and "in public".
  - A description of the possible disagreements between your population and sampling frame and how this would impact your final conclusions.
  - How you are deriving the estimated percentage (bonus points for deriving associated the uncertainties but this is not required).
  - Any challenges and/or decisions you have made **during** the data collection process.
  - How are you validating your sample's quality, e.g. do you have the correct proportions for men vs women for your population (you should pull data from external sources as a bench mark instead of assuming 50/50)?
- Your data from one data collection session.
  - You are expected to collect data at least once (one session should produce multiple samples). Please spend between 1-2 hours at most for this session. You should make sure you collect data from a place that will encounter people.
  - Beyond the variable of interest, "mask or not?", you should also collect other pieces of information to help you validate your sample quality.
  - Your measurement procedure should be non-intrusive, i.e. you should not interact with people to obtain your data.
  - Metadata like day, location, and duration of sampling.
- A selfie of you at the location of sampling :)
