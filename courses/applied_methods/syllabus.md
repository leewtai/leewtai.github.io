# Applied Statistical Methods
UN3105 - Fall 2020

This course is meant to give you a survey of various applied statistic methods. This can
vary drastically depending on the instructor's background.

|Topic|What Problems Does It Solve?|
|---|---|
|Sampling and data quality |How do you get the data relevant to your problem?|
|Bayesian Statistics|How do we introduce prior knowledge into modeling?|
|Kalman Filters + Kriging |How do we deal with temporally or spatially dependent data?|
|Survival analysis |How do we deal with censored data?|
|Causal inference|What else can quantify the impact besides randomized controlled trials?|
|(if time allows) Sequential analysis|Can we use the data sequentially without cheating?|

### Expectations
#### - Learning outcomes
- Students should be able to critique data-based studies
- Students should be able to articulate the difference between their ideal dataset and feasible dataset
- Students should be able to collect/wrangle/clean/transform their data
- Students should be able to diagnose models and understand their strength/weaknesses
- Students should be able to identify the classic models for certain types of data/problem
- Students should be able to simulate/hypothesize alternative scenarios that can explain the same patterns in the data


#### - Your Job
  - Come to class, bring your laptop, take chances!
  - Give feedback in office hours or e-mail, I don't want to waste your time.
  - Avoid e-mailing if possible, share your thoughts on the discussion board instead.
  - Participate and ask questions, this is not easy!
    - In class: forecast what should be done, compare with what is happening, then summarize the difference.
    - Canvas: describe what you observe then describe what you expect.
    - To each other: summarize the conversation to ensure you're listening and think constructively before criticizing.

### Logistics
Lectures:
  [TuTh 11:40-12:55 Eastern](https://vergil.registrar.columbia.edu/#/courses/applied%20statistical%20methods) on Zoom (links on Canvas)
Office Hours:
  No office hours for TA, use discussion board for questions
  Instructor office hours by appointment only

### Computer Setup
  - I encourage you to setup your computing environment through [Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks](../../setup/conda_and_navigator_setup.md) since we'll be using Jupyter Notebooks in class.
    - Here's how you typeset [math and code in Jupyter Notebooks](../../setup/jupyter_typeset_pdf.md)
    - The common commands for math and code are [here](../../setup/math_and_code.md)
  - Please have your photo posted on Zoom

### Grading
If your final grade is in [93-100), you will earn at least an A, [90-93) will earn you at least an A-, [87-90) will earn you at least a B+, etc. A grading curve may be applied depending on the class performance but your grade will not be curved downwards. "At least" implies that there's a possibility to earn a grade higher than your actual percentage.

A+ will be rewarded only on exceptional cases. 

#### - Homeworks (20%)
  - Late homeworks will receive 0 credit
  - Your lowest homework grade will be dropped. If you missed Homework0 because you enrolled late, this prevents you from receiving 0.
#### - Projects (70%)
  - Late projects will be penalized by 50% for each day it's late.
  - Projects should be submitted on Canvas
#### - Participation (10%)
  - Instead of attendance, in class activities, recorded through Canvas, is how we'll grade this.
  - To pass the class, you must have at least 50% here.

### Prerequisites
  - Exposure to foundational statistics and probability
  - Course in computing that manipulated data
  - Linear regression

### Textbooks / Supplies
No textbook but references are available on the syllabus.
