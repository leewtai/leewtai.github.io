# How concepts and classes group together

## Introductory statistics course
- Why do we need data?
  - To validate hypotheses, e.g. do heavier things fall faster?
  - To generate hypotheses, e.g. why are zip codes so predictive of someone's credit score?
  - To compare different entities, e.g. are there more people in the US or in the EU?
- How do we summarize data and what are the pro/con of different summaries
  - metrics, e.g. mean, standard deviations, percentiles, etc
  - graphs, e.g. box plots, scatter plots, etc
- How to generalize sample to the population?
  - How the sample was collected matters, e.g. was is randomly chosen or selective?
  - Sample size affects the certainty when generalizing
- Why and how do we model data?
  - Simplifies the problem while being explicit with the assumptions
  - Random variables and their parameters
  - Regression
- How do we make decisions using data?
  - The logic behind hypothesis testing, you can only reject specific hypotheses
- Have an idea of the scope of statistics

## Statistiical Computing
- How is "data" modeled in programming?
  - data types
  - data formats
- How to wrangle data?
  - Subsetting records vs fields
  - How to organize your data
- How do functions and data interact with one another?
  - Graphing data
  - Providing algorithms the correct type of data
- Can you code in a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) fashion?
  - Automating tasks like getting data from websites
  - For-loops
  - If/else
- Can you simulate statistical phenomenons?
  - Central Limit Theorem
  - Random number generation
  - Permutation tests
- Breaking problems into executable tasks

## Models that Learn from Data
- How do we formalizing intuition into definitions?
  - e.g. objective function in regression
  - What else exists besides least squares?
- Parameters, data, errors, and response/labels?
- What is optimization generally?
  - Initial values
  - Constraints
- How do we evaluate models?
- What happens with high dimensions, i.e. complicated models?
- Can we introduce knowledge besides data into models?
  - Priors
  - Constraints
- Formalizing abstract concepts into definitions

## Human-in-the-loop

## Common interpretation issues
- p-value is not the probability Null is TRUE
- Fail to reject is like "failed to show someone was cheating"
- hypothesis testing as a gardar exercise
