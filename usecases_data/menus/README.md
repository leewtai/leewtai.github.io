The Menus site is being retired along with the image server and the API, but you're welcome to continue accessing and exploring the [crowdsourced data stored here](https://nypl-menus-data.s3.amazonaws.com/gzips/2023_03_16_07_02_35_data.tgz). A data dictionary is available [here](http://curatingmenus.org/data_dictionary/). If you'd like to see images of the menus themselves, Digital Collections is our core platform for viewing digitized collections and the menus collection is available [here](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-buttolph-collection-of-menus#/?tab=navigation). Let us know if there's anything else we can do to help.
