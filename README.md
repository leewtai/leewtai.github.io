I'm Wayne, a statistician with a huge passion in statistics education and modern dance.
I've worked as a professional data scientist in agriculture, social networks, and aerospace.

My current goals are to make useful statistics a mandatory subject in high school education all over the world.
There are many reasons why I think this will make the world a better place.

#### Teaching and Side Projects
I teach statistics courses with an applied focus. Applied work is not
"easier" given that real world problems are never easier than textbook problems.
You will constantly be making trade-offs and learning more about how the data relates
to other things. Also, applied work requires you to know some statistical theory. 
This will will inform you on how certain assumption violations may impact your goals
and provide guidance on your data exploration.

My teaching philosophy is actually heavily influenced by my dance background:
- We learn through imitation
- We learn by contrasting old vs new learnings and our own vs other people's perspectives
- We learn by trying to articulate our own ideas

You can find a [list of my courses](courses/README.md) that source material
from several [applied projects](usecases_data/README.md).

There are three statistical concepts that I would like to teach to the world:
- Not all problems are data problems
- How to creatively think of "what else" that could explain the features in the dataset
- Proactively list out the data that can change your opinion?

I'm slowly compiling a [statistics concept inventory](stat_concept_inv/README.md)
overtime.
